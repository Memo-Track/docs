# MemoTrack SAAS: Hospital Management System Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the **MemoTrack SAAS project**, a cutting-edge hospital management application. This system has been meticulously designed to **streamline maintenance and communication processes within diverse hospital environments**. It offers a robust and modern solution by combining a powerful backend and a user-friendly mobile application.

At its core, MemoTrack SAAS facilitates the **creation, tracking, approval, and resolution of "memos"**, which are essentially maintenance requests or incidents across various hospital departments, blocks, and wards. A crucial feature of the system is its **multi-tenancy support**, allowing different hospitals to utilise the application while ensuring **data isolation and tailored access control** for each. The application also leverages **Firebase for real-time notifications (FCM)** and **remote configuration**, significantly enhancing both the user experience and administrative flexibility.

## Key Concepts

*   **SAAS Model**: The application is designed as a Software-as-a-Service solution, enabling multiple hospitals to use it with separate data.
*   **Memo Management**: Memos are central to the application, representing requests or incidents, and the system maintains a complete history using an event-sourcing-like model with `MemoEvents` and `MemoSnapshots`.
*   **Role-Based Access Control**: The system implements a granular permission model, where user actions are controlled based on their assigned roles (e.g., `is_approver`, `is_responder`, `is_creator`, `ADMIN`, `superuser`) within a hospital.
*   **Hybrid Frontend Architecture**: The mobile application is built with Flutter but embeds a React-based web application using `webview_flutter` for rich memo management features.
*   **Precomputed Dashboards**: The backend precomputes dashboard data using cron jobs to provide efficient analytical insights and reporting.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organised into several sections to provide a clear and detailed understanding of the MemoTrack SAAS system. You can navigate to specific areas of interest using the links below:

*   **[Backend Documentation](backend-docs.md)**: Explore the backend built with **Django (Python)**, which handles business logic, data storage, API endpoints, user authentication, and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) integration. This section would detail key modules such as accounts (for user and role management), infrastructure (for hospital structure), and memos (for core memo logic). It also covers cron jobs for dashboard data precomputation and various security considerations specific to the backend.
*   **[Flutter App Documentation](flutter-app-docs.md)**: Delve into the details of the **cross-platform mobile application developed using Flutter (Dart)**, which provides the primary user interface for Android, iOS, and Web. This section would describe features like user authentication, the dashboard overview, the ability to select/switch blocks and wards, and integrations with native device features such as the microphone for speech-to-text, camera/gallery for image upload, and SIM information. It also highlights the extensive use of Firebase for notifications and dynamic configuration.
*   **[React Webview Frontend Documentation](react-webview-frontend-docs.md)**: Understand the **React-based web application that is embedded within the Flutter mobile app via `webview_flutter`**. This component is crucial for handling complex and **rich memo management interactions**, including detailed memo views, speech-to-text functionality (supporting English/Tamil translation), and a dedicated image upload screen. It also covers aspects like user and hospital data injection into the webview's local storage for seamless integration.
